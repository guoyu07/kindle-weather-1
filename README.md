==============

A collection of moving parts necessary to display stuff on my jailbroken Kindle DX.

Root your kindle; I suggest [TurnKey Linux](http://www.turnkeylinux.org/blog/kindle-root)'s walkthrough.

## Credits
Based in large part on the original work by [MatthewPetrov][], I wanted to make stuff appear on my kindle.
